Afterwards, the device disintegrates into worthless ash.</description>

                        <description>A mechanoid power generation unit. The prothean power core will run forever, extracting energy from fluctuations in mass effect fields.\n\nAn internal amplifier system makes it unstable. If damaged, the unit will generate a massive explosion.\n\nSome brave humans steal these from mechanoids for their own use as power plants or defensive bombs. However, an unintentional detonation can be devastating.</description>

                        <description>An organic connection to a larger psychic field. This allows a person to use specific psychic powers that they have learned to influence reality in ways that seem impossible.\n\nHigher levels of psylink permit the use of more powers. Regardless of psylink level, a person can only use specific powers that they have learned.\n\nPsylink comes from a variety of sources. Single-use psylink neuroformer devices can create a psylink. Tribal peoples also know how to develop it through ritual linking with psychically-connected lifeforms.\n\nAs a physical phenomenon in the brain, psylink is poorly-understood by scientists, not least because it seems to actively conceal itself if studied too closely. One thing most agree on is that it somehow connects people to a distant prothean beacon and harnesses its power, possibly through some sort of negotiation or sympathy mechanism.</description>
